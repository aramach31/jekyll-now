I feel a sudden sense of accomplishment, having finally set up my own blog after months and months of procrastination. Frustrated with where my life was going in the summer of 2019, I thought a blog would be a healthy outlet for the maelstrom of emotions in my mind. I just wanted to use the word maelstrom. This is a project I'm truly excited about so I really hope I see this to the end, if there is an end that is.
