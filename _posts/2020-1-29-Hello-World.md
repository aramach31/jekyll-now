title: Am I Alone In This?
---

The world is reeling with Kobe's unfortunate death. Articles are emerging from all over, celebrating his life. A recurring element is his relentless dedication to the sport. I hope I get attached to something, anything, in the future. 

Life becomes topsy turvy in your penultimate year of college. Everyone has a plan. We used to pass judgments on people taking the "easy" route when we were younger. Called them settlers. But having reached here, I can tell you that there is no "easy" route. It takes a lot of guts to say it out loud to yourself, in front of the mirror, that you're going to do this to get a job and then work towards it. Kudos to whoever said it, walked away from the mirror, and accomplished what they wanted to. 

The best and the worst part of a relatively closed-off college is that everyone knows nearly everyone. Its only natural that you get pegged to a career without your consent based on what people think of you. I do not react very positively to societal pressure. This is where I think I can learn a thing or two from Kobe. After reading a lot on his life and legacy, a common theme is his determination to rise above challenges and external pressure. Imagine battling your inner demons every day to emerge a winner. 

Just thinking of it evokes displeasure within me. I am intrinsically lazy. To break the cycle, I dug a little deeper and found something interesting. A synonym for laziness is sloth. Turns out that sloth is one of the seven deadly sins, with the distinction of being the most difficult sin to define and credit as sin. You commit a sin by being lazy. Crazy, right?

Turns out that it's not that straightforward. The Myth of Sisyphus is a 1942 philosophical essay by Albert Camus, introducing the theory of absurdism. According to Wikipedia, "the Absurd" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life, and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe. This gave me an easy way out. I just identified myself as belonging to that portion of the population which finds the universe perpetually meaningless. But according to Camus, we should enjoy the confluence of both. Kobe certainly did. 

While I can digress more to delve into overlapping constructs between absurdism, nihilism, and existentialism, I think I'll end this here with one final thought. Camus calls life inherently meaningless and that we humans foolishly search for meaning our whole lives. I felt reassured after going through his work as I felt less alone in this journey. 

While I don't really know much about basketball or followed Kobe's trajectory over the years, I learned a lot about him in the past couple of days. Sad how someone's death makes you enter their world. After watching his Oscar-winning documentary again, I can say that I am a fan. Maybe not for his athletic prowess, but for the man he was. He might not have led a perfect life, but Kobe didn't commit the sin of sloth. He saw, he grabbed, he dunked. He taught me what was possible. Thank you, Black Mamba.
